# Origo server configuration

### Basic configuration
The configuration of Origo server are split in to two files conf/config.js and conf/dbconfig.js

Both files are a text that makes up a json object. The difference is that dbconfig.js concerns anything that is related to database and config.js contains the other services which is not directly a database.

Since the text in conf/config.js and conf/dbconfig.js are parsed to a JSON object it's important that it is correct JSON syntax in the text otherwise it will fail.

### Configuration options
Configuration explained for the following services:

- ConvertToGeojson - translates a none standard json to GeoJSON FeatureCollection.

		converts - an array which holds one or more configurations of objects that is to be converted.

		name - a unique name for the converting which is used to call on it from the front end.

		url - the url to the JSON which is to be converted.

		title - the title that is used as name in the GeoJSON FeatureCollection.

		arrayOfObjects - the name of the array object in the JSON that holds the objects that is to be converted.

		geometry - the name of the object in the JSON that holds the obects geometry.

		geometry_type - the type of the geometry, values can be Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString, and MultiPolygon.

		geometry_format - the format of the geometry, values can for now be Array or GeometryCollections.

		properties - an array with the names of the objects which should be transferred into properties of the feature in the GeoJSON.

		encoding - the charcter encoding of the JSON if not the standard for GeoJSON which is UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32. Is only needed if encoding isn't UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32 otherwise it's optional.

- IoTProxy - translates data in NGSI-LD standard to GeoJSON FeatureCollection.

If you have data from IoT sensors in NGSI-LD standard and want to read it directly in Origo as a GeoJSON use this service to setup a translation. Read more about NGSI-LD in [NGSI-LD FAQ](https://fiware-datamodels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ngsi-ld_faq/index.html)

		services - an array which holds one or more configurations of type of sensor data to be retrieved.

		name - a unique name for the service which is used to call on it from the front end.

		url - the url to the JSON which is to be converted.

		title - the title that is used as name in the GeoJSON FeatureCollection.

		properties - an array with the names of the objects which should be transferred into properties of the feature in the GeoJSON.

- Overpass - get data from OpenStreetMap through the Overpass API.

A typical query can be to get all nodes tagged with some key within a area limited by a bounding box. Test your queries in [overpass turbo](https://overpass-turbo.eu/) Read more about [Overpass API](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API) Uses the module [query-overpass](https://github.com/perliedman/query-overpass)

		queries - an array which holds one or more query objects that retrieves data from OpenStreetMap.

		name - a unique name for the query which is used to call on it from the front end.

		query - a overpass query which is passed to the API. Test the query in overpass turbo and make sure it's on a single row in the config. Limited support for complex queries.

		title - the title that is used as name in the GeoJSON FeatureCollection.

		options - optional options to be set which currently is overpassUrl and flatProperties

- Trafikverket API - get data from Trafikverket API.

To use the API you must have a authentication key, which can be obtained by registration on [Trafikverkets Ã¶ppna API](https://api.trafikinfo.trafikverket.se/) or [Trafiklab API](https://www.trafiklab.se/api)

		services - an array which holds one or more configurations of questions that is to be executed.

		name - a unique name for the service which is used to call on it from the front end.

		url - the url to the API.

		title - the title that is used as name in the GeoJSON FeatureCollection.

		query - a query that is accepted by the Trafikverket API in XML-format inclusive the authentication key.

		type - the object type of the response, currently only Siuation is implemented.
